Although after a point, you'll start hitting resource limits.  You
            can do a 'LIMIT X OFFSET Y' (maybe unsure on the syntax there) to
            avoid that.
			Oh.  I've happily got code that gets back a set of status updates
            for a person, and then looks at all the comments on them.
It involved a bit of trickery... one sec.
        SELECT fromid, text, username
        FROM comment
        WHERE post_id IN (
            SELECT concat('%friend%_', status_id)
            FROM status
            WHERE uid = '%friend%'
